## Show distro codename

To determine the code name of the system you are running, open a terminal and use the command

``lsb_release -a``

example output on my ThinkPad X230 running Ubuntu:

``No LSB modules are available.  
Distributor ID:	Ubuntu  
Description:	Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS  
Release:	18.04  
#Codename:	bionic``
