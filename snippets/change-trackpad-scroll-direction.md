## How to adjust ThinkPad trackpad scroll direction

On Pop!_OS the default for the trackpad/touchpad is when you two-finger scroll upwards, your browser or text document will scroll upwards.  

You may prefer for your page to scroll down with this gesture...  

To adjust this setting you need to go into:  

`Settings > Devices > Mouse & Touchpad`

and under the heading *Touchpad* you can turn on 'Natural Scrolling' 

"Scrolling moves the content, not the view"

This will do the trick.
